# Formats
Due to *unnecessary* complications, I've made this file because the file formats used are... complicated, and having a place to write down the formats to allow for my own development and others is pretty useful, I'd say.

This should be divided into three main sections: Danganronpa formats, SPIRAL formats, and Misc formats.

In 99% of cases the formats here have been discovered and reverse engineered by someone else, in which case I'll have a link to the article/s that I used where applicable.

Should also be noted that, unless specified, the formats seem to use little endian byte orders.

# Danganronpa Formats

Fairly self explanatory, this section is for formats that are either specialised for Danganronpa, or are special/proprietary formats used.

Common examples:
* WAD
* PAK
* LIN
* CPK

## WAD

While listed here as a Danganronpa format, from what I can tell, WAD files were first used in Hotline Miami.

If you do a search for ["WAD Format"](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=WAD+format), you do get two other results - DOOM, and a Wii homebrew packaging format. From what I can tell, neither of these are the formats used.

WAD files are general purpose archives, for the most part. No compression here, thank god. They store a version number, a file list, and a list of directories and the file hierarchy, as well as the actual file data.

Enough talk, let's move onto the format itself!

* Wad Type? - 4 byte header, spelling out AGAR in ASCII
* Major Version - 4 byte integer
* Minor Version - 4 byte integer
* Header Size - 4 byte integer
* Header - [Header Size] bytes
* Number of Files - 4 byte integer, file format is as follows
  * File Name Length - 4 byte integer
  * File Name - [File Name Length] bytes
  * File Size - 8 byte long (number)
  * File Offset - 8 byte long (number)
* Number of Directories - 4 byte integer, directory format is as follows
  * Directory Name Length - 4 byte integer
  * Directory Name - [Directory Name Length] bytes
  * Number of Subfiles - 4 byte integer, subfile format is as follows
    * Subfile Name Length - 4 byte integer
    * Subfile Name - [Subfile Name Length] bytes
    * Is File - 1 byte, 0 for true, 1 for false
* File Data, at offsets defined in [File Format]

There's two peculiarities about the Danganronpa interpretation that should be noted though.
1. The Major/Minor versions do not matter. Danganronpa handles any version just fine. May steal for SPIRAL versioning, who knows.
2. **Do not attempt to use a header.** I repeat - ***Do not attempt to use the header field for a Danganronpa WAD file at this time***. 
    * Danganronpa ignores this field, but worst of all, it will crash, since it doesn't even read the size and skip over. Do not use this field.
    * If you need to store header information, SPIRAL provides a nifty Spiral Header file, which is included. Doesn't do anything, just there as a nice, easy alternative to the default WAD header.
    
## PAK

In a similar situation to WAD files, the PAK format may exist outside of Danganronpa, although I haven't been able to find suitable information on it's existance.

Similar to WAD files, PAK files are general archives. With one key difference, however - PAK files have no concept of format or names.

PAK archives can be thought more of as lists of data blobs than an actual structured archive. 

The use case for these tends to be when the engine knows what type of data it's expecting, and doesn't care about things like names. Things like animations work well here.

* Number of files - 4 byte integer, SPIRAL caps it out at 1024 to prevent memory issues.
* List of file offsets - Many 4 byte integers, up to [Number of Files] (Total size is therefore [Number of Files] * 4)
* File Data - Data is read from one file offset to another, meaning the first file is from the first offset to the second, the second file is the second offset to the third, and so on.

## LIN

A completely new format (I believe), and also the most complicated of them all. The LIN format is responsible for scripting files.

Ideally, you don't deal directly with LIN formats, and can use the custom SPIRAL format as a form of abstraction. However, sometimes you may require, or prefer, the precision of the LIN format.

* LIN Type - 4 byte integer, 1 for text, and 2 for any other. 
* Header Space - 4 byte integer.
* Size | Text Block - 4 byte integer. The use of this number varies from the two format.
* Size - 4 byte integer. Only present if LIN Type is `other`. If it's a Text LIN, then Text Block is equal to the size.
* Presumably the header - `[Header Space] - 16` bytes. Unknown
* Script Entry Definitions - Any number, between [Header Space] and [Text Block]. Format is as follows
  * `0x70` - If not present, skip over until we reach `0x70`
  * OP Code - 1 byte, short obviously for Operation Code. See the list below for a full list.
  * Arguments for the OP Code - 1 byte per argument, up till either the number of arguments for the code, or till `0x70` if the argument number is `-1`
* Number of Text Entries - 4 byte integer, details the number of text entries.
* Text Entries - [Number of Text Entries] long. Format is below:
  * Text Position - 4 byte integer. The starting point of the text to read.
  * Next Text Position - 4 byte integer. The ending point of this line of text.
  * Text - [Next Text Position] - [Text Position] bytes. UTF-16 string. The actual text itself, assigned to the entry `i`, where `i` is the iteration count (0-indexed)
  
## Nonstop Debates (DAT files)

Nonstop debates have a number of files associated with them, but this is focusing on just the `.dat` files you see 
  
## 'SHTX'

It's `CURRENT_YEAR` why are we still using obscure image formats

Regardless, the 'SHTX' format seems to be a format used for Danganronpa: Another Episode/Ultra Despair Girls. 

Fairly simple, but still annoying, it consists of a series of "subformats" that are still being documented

* `SHTX` - Magic Number, or `0x53 0x48 0x54 0x58`
* Format - 2 characters. The formats are as follows
    * `Fs` - The most common one, an 8 bit image defined with a palette
        * Width - 2 byte integer, unsigned. 
        * Height - 2 byte integer, unsigned.
        * Unknown - 2 byte integer
        * Palette Definitions - 256 of them, as follows
            * Red Value - 1 byte
            * Green Value - 1 byte
            * Blue Value - 1 byte
            * Alpha Value - 1 byte
        * Pixels - Each byte corresponds to the palette entry as defined before. Indexed as rows (So 0,0 -> 16,0 and then 0,1 -> 16,1 and so on so forth)
    * `Ff` - Less common, used for only a few images.
        * Width - 2 byte integer, unsigned. 
        * Height - 2 byte integer, unsigned.
        * Unknown - 2 byte integer
        * Pixels - `width` * `height` of them, as follows
            * Red Value - 1 byte
            * Green Value - 1 byte
            * Blue Value - 1 byte
            * Alpha Value - 1 byte

# Misc Formats

## TGA

TGA files are a mess, which is why I was glad to not have to handle them myself. If you're interested in the technical details of the format, you can check [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA#Technical_details).

## DXT/DDS

Credit: So many sites, and a pretty common format, but the final touches were obtained from [npedotnet/DDSReader](https://github.com/npedotnet/DDSReader)

I'll fill this in later, I don't like them.


# OP Codes

For simplicity, there are several points where IDs are handled as either `arg 1 + arg 2 * 256`, or the reverse (`arg 1 * 256 + arg 2`). 

These will be denoted as `[ID]` and `{ID}` respectively (So `[ID]` for `arg 1 + arg 2 * 256`, and `{ID}` for `arg 1 * 256 + arg 2`)

## Danganronpa 1

* `0x00` - Text Count, two arguments. The number of text lines in the file. Argument 1 is the remainder of the full number divided by 256, and the second is the full number divided by 256.
* `0x01` - Unknown, three arguments.
* `0x02` - Text. The basis of the game, really. Two arguments. The first is the starting offset (0-indexed) of the text to read, and the second argument is the ending offset.
* `0x03` - Format. One argument. This is used for things like bolding, self talk, and so forth. `3` is **bold**, `4` is used for when the protag talks to themself, `17` is used for the Weak Points in class trials, and `69` is used when you `agree` with a statement.
  * Note: Formatting may be used, and may occur, in text lines, as `<CLT>`. For instance, to bold a particular statement, you would have `This sentence has a <CLT 3>BOLD<CLT> word in it`
* `0x04` - Filter. Four arguments. The filter to apply to a scene. Argument 1 is always 1, Argument 2 is the filter used (0 is normal, 1 is flashback), and 3 & 4 is 0
* `0x05` - Movie. Two arguments. Two arguments make up the movie `{ID}`
* `0x06` - Animation. Eight arguments. Argument 1 is the animation ID divided by 256, the second is the remainder. The third to seventh arguments are unknown. The eighth argument is the frame to use, and 255 to hide it.
* `0x07` - Unknown
* `0x08` - Voice Line, Five arguments. The first is the character ID (See below). The second is the chapter to pull from, set to `99` for no chapter. The third argument is the voice line `{ID}`. The fifth argument is the volume *percentage* (At least, I assume so). Default to 100.
* `0x09` - Music, three arguments. First is the music number (or `255` to stop any music playing), second is the transition. Third is the volume percentage.
* `0x0A` - SFX A, three arguments. Suspect it follows the same format as `0x09`, but for sound effects.
* `0x0B` - SFX B, two arguments. Unknown.
* `0x0C` - Toggle Truth Bullet, two arguments. The first argument is the ID of the truth bullet, or piece of evidence, to either enable or disable. The second argument is 0 to disable, and 1 to enable. Using `255, 0` as the arguments should clear the evidence list.
    * Update: I don't quite think this is right, but further testing is required.
* `0x0D` - Unknown, three arguments.
* `0x0E` - Unknown, two arguments.
* `0x0F` - Set Title, three arguments. Argument 1 is character ID, argument 2 seems to always be `0`, and argument 3 is the state of the title? Purpose is unknown, possibly used for report cards.
* `0x10` - Set Report Info, three arguments. Argument 1 is character ID, argument 2 seems to always be `0`, and argument 3 is the state of the info. Seems to be used to update the info available in the report card.
* `0x11` - Unknown, four arguments.
* `0x12` - Unknown
* `0x13` - Unknown
* `0x14` - Trial Camera, three arguments. Argument 1 is the character to focus on, arguments 2 and 3 make up the Motion `{ID}`
* `0x15` - Load Map, three arguments. Argument 1 is the room, argument 2 is the state, and argument 3 is padding.
* `0x16` - Unknown
* `0x17` - Unknown
* `0x18` - Unknown
* `0x19` - Script, three arguments. Argument 1 is the chapter, argument 2 is the scene, and argument 3 is the room. Essentially, runs the script `e[arg1]_[arg2]_[arg3]`
* `0x1A` - Stop Script, no arguments.
* `0x1B` - Run Script, three arguments. Same syntax as `0x19`. Seems to be used for quick return scripts.
* `0x1C` - Unknown, no arguments.
* `0x1D` - Unknown
* `0x1E` - Sprite, five arguments. Argument 1 is the object ID to map to, argument 2 is the character ID to use for the sprite. Argument 3 is the sprite ID, and argument 4 is the sprite state. Argument 5 is the sprite type.
* `0x1F` - Unknown, seven arguments.
* `0x20` - Unknown, five arguments.
* `0x21` - Speaker, one argument. Singular argument is the character ID.
* `0x22` - Fade, three arguments. Argument 1 is 0 or 1, meaning fade in and fade out respectively. Second argument may be delay but testing is needed. Argument 3 is time. A fade in seems to be required at the start of any script that loads a new room or the game will be stuck at a black screen. Fade time must be more than 0.
* `0x23` - Unknown, five arguments.
* `0x24` - Unknown.
* `0x25` - Change UI, two arguments. Argument 1 is the element to change, argument 2 is the state to change it to.
* `0x26` - Set Flag, three arguments. Argument 1 is the group, argument 2 is the ID, and argument 3 is the state.
* `0x27` - Check Character, one argument. Argument 1 is the character ID. Used in move abouts and investigation to allow for interacting with a student. Think of it as a function header, or an `IF` check.
* `0x28` - Unknown
* `0x29` - Check Object, one argument. Argument 1 is the object ID. See `0x27`
* `0x2A` - Set Label, two arguments. Arguments 1 and 2 make up the label `[ID]`
* `0x2B` - Choice, one argument. Unknown
* `0x2C` - Unknown, two arguments.
* `0x2D` - Unknown
* `0x2E` - Unknown, two arguments.
* `0x2F` - Unknown, *ten* arguments.
* `0x30` - Show Background, three arguments. Argument 1 and 2 make up the background `[ID]`, and argument 3 is the state.
* `0x31` - Unknown
* `0x32` - Unknown, one argument.
* `0x33` - Wait?, four arguments.
* `0x34` - Goto Label, two arguments. Argument 1 and 2 make up the label `[ID]`. See `0x2A`.
* `0x35` - Check Flag A, dynamic number of arguments. Combined with `0x36`, almost certainly the most complicated OP code in the game. See below.
* `0x36` - Check Flag B, dynamic number of arguments. Combined with `0x35`, almost certainly the most complicated OP code in the game. See below.
* `0x37` - Unknown
* `0x38` - Unknown
* `0x39` - Unknown, five arguments.
* `0x3A` - Wait For Input, no arguments. Waits for the user to press enter, or click next.
* `0x3B` - Wait Frame, no arguments. Waits a frame
* `0x3C` - End Flag Check, no arguments. Presumably used to signify an end to `0x35` and `0x36`.
